 * Through the usage of loops, the isTargetNorth and isTargetEast functions were fairly intuitive to design. The isTargetNorth function produced simplistic solutions through a line of simplistic code as that of isTargetEast. When designing the heading controller, I chose to set the heading of the Robot to be North so that the absolute and relative directions would be easy to match. As such, within this model, north became equivalent to ahead, east became equivalent to right, west became equivalent to left, and south became equivalent to behind. These setting-based relations allowed the rest of the code to be fairly efficient. The rest of the code used if-else statements, do-while statements, etc to string together the code in a manner that was easy to understand and highly efficient.

Despite meeting the existing specifications of exercise 3 itself, it was recommended to meet the specifications of exercise 1 as well which is why I developed a log that functions through execution of the code as well. Although the code I generated for exercise 3 was highly efficient, it was impossible to make it completely effective. The nature of the specification makes it impossible to create code that consistently reaches the target each time it is run as based on the maze environment, the robot may not exactly always be able to reach the robot by just sensing the direction it is in. I found that a lot of the time, the robot got stuck in loops at corners and deadends where the path towards the target wasnâ€™t completely straight.
